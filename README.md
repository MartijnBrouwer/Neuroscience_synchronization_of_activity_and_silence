# Numerical simulation of the synchronization of silence and activity in the neocortex

This code contains the simulation of a coupled excitatory-inhibitory model which proves the lateral propagation of states. It calculates the standard deviation of the onset delays of both active and silent states and shows that the synchronization of silent states are more precise.
